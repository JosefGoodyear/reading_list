# Reading List
### Description
Search for books using the Google Books API, add them to a local reading list, and view that reading list.
### Requirements
This project was tested with Python 3.7 and requires Python 3 and the requests module to run properly. An internet connection is required to add books to the reading list, but the reading list can be viewed offline.

Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are included if you want to use a virtual environment. Just run ```pipenv install``` and ```pipenv shell```.

### Usage
Clone this project and type ```./read.py``` into the command line to start the program. From there, follow the instructions in your terminal.
